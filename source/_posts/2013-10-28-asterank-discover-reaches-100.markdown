The 100,000th image was screened on [Asterank Discover](http://asterank.com/discover), the crowdsourced asteroid discovery app, last month.  Since its launch this past summer, thousands of people have tried spotting asteroids in public imagery gathered from astronomical sky surveys, and hundreds have marked potentially undiscovered asteroids.

Most of these 100,000 images had been gathering dust for years, scanned by computers but unseen by more accurate human eyes.  Crowdsourcing discovery is a good way to make this happen...

The goal of the Discover project is a prototype intended to put science in the hands of people.
