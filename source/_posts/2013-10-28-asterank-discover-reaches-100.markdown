In late October, someone reviewed the 100,000th image on [Asterank Discover](http://asterank.com/discover), the crowdsourced asteroid discovery app.  This is a significant milestone and I want to give a huge thanks to the thousands of people who've contributed.

## Why this matters

We know there are millions of asteroids out there, but we're not able to find and track them all.  The majority of undiscovered asteroids are relatively small, similar to the one that exploded over Russia last February, and many have orbits that classify them as "Near-Earth Asteroids" (NEAs).  We're discovering new asteroids at the rate of several per day.

Sky surveys have been collecting images of the night sky for decades in order to search for these asteroids, but the resulting data is largely underscrutinized.  Most images have been gathering dust for years, forgotten in archives after being scanned by computers once but never reviewed by human eyes.  I've [discussed](http://www.ianww.com/2013/08/05/how-a-programmer-can-discover-an-asteroid/) in the past why human reviewal is an important part of this process.  It will ultimately lead to better computer detection with fewer false positives (right now, everything asteroid algorithms find has to be reviewed by a human anyway).

## Planetary Resources and Asteroid Zoo

Asterank Discover will soon fold into a larger project called Asteroid Zoo, now that [Asterank](http://asterank.com) has been acquired by [Planetary Resources](http://www.planetaryresources.com).

Last week, PRI [announced](http://www.nbcnews.com/science/nasa-planetary-resources-partner-asteroid-hunting-contests-2D11638181) its plans with NASA and Zooniverse to crowdsource reviewal of high-quality images from the Catalina Sky Survey.

"Asteroid Zoo" will be a much smarter and more engaging app that uses the proven methodology of Zooniverse (who did Galaxy Zoo, Ice Hunters, and other successful projects).  Asterank Discover was great validation for this approach, and sets us up nicely with some preliminary data to test against.

I'm very excited to see where this will lead.  This approach will discover new asteroids and improve our model of the solar system.  It also leads to interesting things like having to calculate orbital solutions and notify the people who found them.
