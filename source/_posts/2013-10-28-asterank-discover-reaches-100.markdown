A few days ago the 100,000th image was screened on [Asterank Discover](http://asterank.com/discover), the crowdsourced asteroid discovery app.  Since its launch this past summer, thousands of people have tried spotting asteroids in public imagery gathered from astronomical sky surveys.

Most of these images had been gathering dust for years, scanned by computers but unseen by more accurate human eyes.  The Discover project is a prototype intended to put science in the hands of people.
