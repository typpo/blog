The story of my side project starts in May 2012 as a tired cliche: a programmer in a coffee shop on his MacBook Air.

Earlier that week, [Planetary Resources](http://www.planetaryresources.com/) had announced its intent to mine asteroids with the backing of a number of prominent investors.  Like many others, I was intrigued.  It was a bold, impossible startup that had no chance at near-term success and reliant on uproven technology.

My project began as a thought experiment.  I was frustrated by the media's wild asteroid value estimates that had no scientific basis.  No one was doing the math to find out how much these objects were really worth, so I decided to take on the challenge.

13 months later, Asterank was acquired by Planetary Resources.  It became much more than an asteroid value calculator.  It is a full astronomical toolkit and app including web scrapers, a data pipeline, powerful visualizations, and the ability to discover new asteroids.

**I had no idea what I was doing.**  I still don't.  But here are some lessons I've learned along the way:

## Bug people

I spent lots of time contacting people who could help me either materially or by critiquing my project.

This is common advice, but people usually don't take it seriously.  The key is being patient and not coming off as desperate.  Follow up every two weeks if you've had near-term contact, one month if you haven't.

### Cold email guidelines

Here's a cold email structure that worked for me:

  * Briefly describe what I made and the success I've already had (# visitors, news coverage, etc.).
  * Tell them what I'm planning on doing.
  * Ask them for something.

Sometimes I tracked their clicks, eg. linking `http://asterank.com/?f=n`, where n is a unique string.  This way, even if they didn't respond, I could tell who was interested enough to click my link.

Guidelines for following up:

  * Update on project (latest successes, features, etc.).
  * Ask them for something.

If you are following up on a promise they've already made, **don't** give an update.  Instead, just send a brief email asking them to follow through.  You want to maximize their chance of reading.

### Choosing the victims

Here is a list of people I emailed regularly:

  * my contact at Planetary Resources.
  * contacts at other space companies.
  * space bloggers.
  * scientists at prestigious institutions.
  * the professor who taught my 100-person Intro to Astronomy course.
  * many others.

Over time, people started initiating contact instead of the other way around.

[Boomerang for Gmail](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/) is a great tool for email reminders.  I used the free version and followed up once a month with people I was interested in.

Most of your emails won't get read.  This can be insulting and stressful.  Hang in there and take nothing personally.


## Get someone else to link to you

My start came from a post on [Universe Today](http://www.universetoday.com/), a popular space blog.  A couple people including some guys from PRI contacted me afterwards.

The only self-promotion I did was my [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3967670) that gained a total of 2 points, which I deserved for giving it such an awful linkbait title.

Did you know you can "submit" to HN as many times as you want?  If no one is interested in your project, just blog about it until someone is.  I posted [Asterank Discover](http://asterank.com/discover) to HN and it got 5 points.  I wrote a blog post about it and it made it to the front page.  Go figure.

## LinkedIn can be useful if you're tackling an outside industry

LinkedIn is full of bullshit, but most people are on it.  LinkedIn allowed the Planetary Resources guys to find me initially.  Many software engineers I know question the value of LinkedIn, but maintaining a basic, up-to-date profile was worth it.

## Put your contact info on the site and ask for feedback

Some of my best contacts came through my site's About/Feedback page.  They wound up contributing significantly to the project.  Not everyone will hunt down your github project.

I used to have a feedback form but now I just give my email.  People seemed to like the feedback form more.

## Make it open source

## Analytics

I checked out referrals to my site and made a couple contacts just by noticing referrals from company email.  I reached out without referencing that I was monitoring referral logs, but it's an easier "cold" contact because you know they're already interested.

## Take every random opportunity that arises

I was invited to ideacity, Canada's smaller and slightly more eccentric version of TED, because Moses Znaimer read an article about me in the Daily Mail, which quoted the Universe Today article.  This was completely random.

This fall, I'm headed to the World Technology Awards conference in New York.  Someone nominated me in the space category.  I was beaten by Elon Musk, Peter Diamandis, and a couple other folks (no surprise there), but now I have the opportunity to stand awkwardly amongst much older, more accomplished people with the same interests as me.  I'm terrified but who knows what will come of it.

## This is a good way to get a job

Received multiple job opportunities and conference invites from this project.

## Stick with it

I have 5+ side projects that are good - some of which I feel like could be businesses themselves.  But I'd always get bored after a couple weeks.  Asterank was the only side project that I've stuck with for over a year, and it paid off.

## Be grateful

I had to make some hard decisions and turn down some great opportunities to wind up here.  I'm really lucky to have had those options.

I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm excited to learn and see where this takes me.

Good luck!
