My side project began as a cliche: a programmer  in a coffee shop on his MacBook Air.

In May 2012, [Planetary Resources](http://www.planetaryresources.com/) announced its intent to mine asteroids with the backing of a number of prominent investors including Larry Page, Eric Schmidt, and Ross Perot Jr.

When I heard the announcement, I was very interested.

More recently, the completed a Kickstarter that raised $1.5 million toward the development of a space-based telescope.

## Bug people

This is common advice, but it works.  The hard part is being patient and not coming off as desperate.  I thought the stress of waiting for slow turnaround would kill me over the course of a year.

Boomerang is a great tool for this.  I followed up once a month with people I was interested in.

Here's an example email

I bugged my contact at PRI every month.

I bugged other space companies

I bugged scientists at prestigious institutions.

I bugged the professor who taught my 100-person Intro to Astronomy course.

Boomerang is freemium; I didn't wind up needing the paid version, but I considered it and eventually started writing my own self-hosted version, which doesn't quite work yet.

## Get someone else to link to you

Doesn't matter how you do it.  My start came from a post by Nancy Atkinson over at Universe Today.  I didn't spend much time promoting it, but a couple people including some guys from PRI contacted me after.

I suspect my original break came from my [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3967670) that gained a grand total of 2 points (which I deserved for giving it a miserable linkbaity title).

You can submit to HN as many times as you want - if your link to your project fails, write a post about it.

## LinkedIn can be useful if you're tackling an outside industry

LinkedIn is full of bullshit, but it's the one place where most people are professionally.  If it weren't for LinkedIn, I wouldn't have been contacted by Planetary Resources (or they would've worked harder to find me).

## Always ask for feedback on your site

Some of my best contacts and people who helped significantly with the project contacted me through the site's About page.  Not everyone will hunt down your github project.  I should make it even easier for people to contact me.

## Analytics

I checked out referrals to my site and made a couple contacts by noticing referrals from company email sites.  It's easier because they're already interested in you.

It goes without saying, but keep tabs on who's linking to you.

## Take every random opportunity that arises

I was invited to ideacity, Canada's smaller and slightly more eccentric version of TED, because Moses Znaimer read an article about me in the Daily Mail, which quoted the Universe Today article.  A completely random event.

This fall, I'm headed to the World Technology Awards conference in New York.  Someone nominated me in the space category.  I was beaten by Elon Musk, Peter Diamandis, and a couple other folks, but now I have the opportunity to stand awkwardly amongst much older, more accomplished people with the same interests as me.  I'm terrified but who knows what will come of it.

## Stick with it

I have 10+ side projects that were great - some of which I feel like could be businesses themselves.  But I'd always get bored after a couple weeks.  Asterank was the only side project that I've stuck with for over a year.

## Be grateful

I had to make some hard decisions and turn down some great opportunities to wind up here.  I tried my best not to burn any bridges.

I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm excited to learn and see where this takes me.

Good luck!
