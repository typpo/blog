The story of my side project starts in May 2012 as a tired cliche: a programmer in a coffee shop on his MacBook Air.

Earlier that week, [Planetary Resources](http://www.planetaryresources.com/) had [announced](http://www.space.com/15395-asteroid-mining-planetary-resources.html) its intent to mine asteroids.  Like many others, I was intrigued.  It was a bold, impossible startup that had long-term vision and pushed a lot of boundaries.

[Asterank](http://asterank.com) began as a thought experiment.  I was frustrated by the media's wild asteroid value estimates that had no scientific basis.  No one else was doing the math to find out how much these objects were really worth.

13 months later, when Asterank was acquired by Planetary Resources, it was much more than an asteroid value calculator.  It was a full astronomical toolkit and app including web scrapers, a data pipeline, powerful visualizations, and the ability to discover new asteroids.

**I had no idea what I was doing.**  I still don't.  But here are some lessons I've learned along the way:

## Bug people

I contacted many people who could help me materially or by critiquing my project.

This is common advice, but people usually don't take it seriously.  The key is being patient and not coming off as desperate.  Follow up every two weeks if you've had near-term contact, one month if you haven't.

### Cold email guidelines

Here's the cold email structure that worked for me:

  * Briefly describe what I made and the success I've already had (# visitors, news coverage, etc.).
  * Briefly tell them what my goal is.
  * Ask them for something that will help me accomplish this goal.

Sometimes I tracked clicks by linking `http://asterank.com/?f=n`, where n is a unique string.  This way, even if they didn't respond, I could tell who was interested enough to click through by looking at analytics.

Guidelines for following up:

  * Update on project (latest successes, features, etc.).  Don't include this if you are following up on a specific promise they already made.
  * Ask them for something.

### Choosing the victims

Here are some of the people I emailed regularly:

  * my contact at Planetary Resources.
  * contacts at many other space companies.
  * scientists at prestigious institutions.
  * space bloggers.
  * the professor who taught my 100-person Intro to Astronomy course.

Most of your emails won't get read.  This can be insulting and stressful.  Hang in there and take nothing personally.

[Boomerang for Gmail](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/) is a great tool for email reminders.  I used the free version and followed up once a month with people I was interested in.

Over time, people started initiating contact instead of the other way around, and my network grew.

## Get someone else to link to you

When I launched, the only self-promotion I did was a [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3967670), which gained a total of 2 points (I deserved this for giving it such an awful linkbait title).

Fortunately, someone picked it up and it was posted on [Universe Today](http://www.universetoday.com/95169/the-most-profitable-asteroid-is/), a popular space blog.  A couple people including the Planetary Resources leadership contacted me afterwards.  From then on, traffic was steady with spikes from aggregators, news coverage, etc.

Did you know you can "submit" to HN as many times as you want?  If no one is interested in your project, just blog about it until someone is.  I posted [Asterank Discover](http://asterank.com/discover) to HN and it got 5 points.  I wrote a [blog post](www.ianww.com/blog/2013/08/05/how-a-programmer-can-discover-an-asteroid/) on it that made it to the front page.  Go figure.

## Put your contact info on the site and ask for feedback

Some of my best contacts came through my site's About/Feedback page.  They wound up contributing significantly to the project.  Very few people will contribute to your github repo, even if you link it.

I tried a basic contact form and gave my email address.  People seemed to like the feedback form more.  Now I have both.

I used to let people subscribe to updates, but all it really did was send me their email address.  I used this to gage interest; there was no point in setting up a mailing list before I knew people would use it.

Incidentally, the About page is the channel where several job opportunities/conference invitiations/interview requests came through.

## LinkedIn can sometimes be useful

LinkedIn is full of bs, but most people are on it.  This is especially useful if you're tackling something outside tech.  It allowed the Planetary Resources guys to find me initially.

Many software engineers I know question the value of LinkedIn.  It may cost you some sanity, but maintaining a basic, up-to-date profile was worth it.

## Open source everything you can

This advice may not apply to everyone, but most people are surprised when I tell them Asterank was all [open source](https://github.com/typpo/asterank).  I suppose the name and brand itself was worth something, as well as the collaboration and contacts that the project fostered.

I noticed that most people who said they wanted to contribute never wind up contributing. But open sourcing was still a great way to meet people who wanted to support and innovate the project.

## Monitor analytics

Scan your analytics every now and then, especially referers.  I made a valuable contact just by noticing a referral from company email.  Reach out without referencing that I was monitoring referral logs, but it's much easier to "cold" contact someone you know is already interested.

## Take every random opportunity that arises

I was invited to ideacity, Canada's smaller and slightly more eccentric version of TED, because the organizer read an article about Asterank in the Daily Mail, which quoted the Universe Today article.  This was unexpected.

I've gotten a handful of other interview requests, scientific collaborators, game devs get in touch, etc. - all interesting and unique opportunities.

This fall, I'm headed to the World Technology Awards in New York.  Someone nominated me in the space category, but I was beaten by Elon Musk, Peter Diamandis, and a couple other folks.  No surprise there - but now I have the opportunity to stand awkwardly amongst much older, more accomplished people with the same interests as me.  I'm terrified but who knows what will come of it.

## Stick with it

I have 5+ side projects. I feel some of them could be businesses, but I always get bored after a couple weeks.  Asterank was the only side project that I've stuck with for over a year, and it paid off even though I didn't think I could ever monetize it.

## Be grateful

I had to make some hard decisions and turn down some great opportunities to wind up here.  I'm really lucky to have had those options.

I'm excited to learn and see where this takes me.

Good luck!
