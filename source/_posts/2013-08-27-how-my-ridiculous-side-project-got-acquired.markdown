The story of my side project starts in May 2012 and is a tired cliche: a programmer in a coffee shop on his MacBook Air.

Earlier that week, [Planetary Resources](http://www.planetaryresources.com/) had announced its intent to mine asteroids with the backing of a number of prominent investors.  Like many others, I was intrigued.  It was a bold, impossible startup that had no chance at near-term success and reliant on uproven technology.

My project began as a thought experiment.  I was frustrated by the media's wild asteroid value estimates that had no scientific basis.  No one was doing the math to find out how much these objects really were worth, so I decided to take on that challenge.

13 months later, Asterank was acquired by Planetary Resources.  It became much more than an asteroid value estimator.  It is a full astronomical toolkit including web scrapers, a data pipeline, powerful visualizations, and the ability to discover new asteroids.

Here's how I got what I wanted:

## Bug people

This works.  The key is being patient and not coming off as desperate.

Follow up with people every two weeks if you've had near-term contact, one month if you haven't.

Cold email guidelines that worked for me:

  * Briefly cover what I made and the success I've already had (# visitors, news coverage, etc.).
  * Tell them what I'm planning on doing.
  * Ask them for something.

Sometimes I put in tracking urls, eg. linking `http://asterank.com/?f=n`, where n is a number and then incrementing that number for each person.  This way, you can tell who was interested enough to click your link, even if they don't respond.

Guidelines for follow up email:

  * Update on project (latest successes, features, etc.).
  * Ask them for something.

>> If you are following up on a specific promise, **don't** give an update.  Instead, just send a brief email asking them to follow up.  You want to maximize their chance of reading.

Here is a list of people I bugged regularly:

  * my contact at Planetary Resources.

  * people other space companies.

  * scientists at prestigious institutions.

  * the professor who taught my 100-person Intro to Astronomy course.

  * friends and family.

  * many others.

Most your emails won't get read.  This can be incredibly insulting and stressful.  Just hang in there and take nothing personally.

[Boomerang for Gmail](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/) is a great tool for this.  I followed up once a month with people I was interested in.

Boomerang is freemium; I didn't wind up needing the paid version, but I considered it and eventually [started writing](https://github.com/typpo/gmail-bumpit) my own self-hosted version, which doesn't quite work yet.

## Get someone else to link to you

My start came from a post on [Universe Today](http://www.universetoday.com/), a popular space blog.  A couple people including some guys from PRI contacted me afterwards.

The only self-promotion I did was my [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3967670) that gained a total of 2 points, which I deserved for giving it such an awful linkbait title.

P.S. Did you know you can submit to HN as many times as you want?  If no one is interested in your project, just blog about it until someone is.  I posted [Asterank Discover](http://asterank.com/discover) to HN and it got 5 points.  I wrote a blog post about it and it made it to the front page.  Go figure.

## LinkedIn can be useful if you're tackling an outside industry

LinkedIn is full of bullshit, but most people are on it.  LinkedIn allowed the Planetary Resources guys to find me initially.

## Put contact info on your site and ask for feedback

Some of my best contacts came through my site's About/Feedback page.  They wound up contributing significantly to the project.  Not everyone will hunt down your github project.

If anything I should've made it even easier to give feedback.

## Make it open source

## Analytics

I checked out referrals to my site and made a couple contacts just by noticing referrals from company email.  I reached out without referencing that I was monitoring referral logs, but it's an easier "cold" contact because you know they're already interested.

## Take every random opportunity that arises

I was invited to ideacity, Canada's smaller and slightly more eccentric version of TED, because Moses Znaimer read an article about me in the Daily Mail, which quoted the Universe Today article.  This was completely random.

This fall, I'm headed to the World Technology Awards conference in New York.  Someone nominated me in the space category.  I was beaten by Elon Musk, Peter Diamandis, and a couple other folks (no surprise there), but now I have the opportunity to stand awkwardly amongst much older, more accomplished people with the same interests as me.  I'm terrified but who knows what will come of it.

## Stick with it

I have 5+ side projects that are good - some of which I feel like could be businesses themselves.  But I'd always get bored after a couple weeks.  Asterank was the only side project that I've stuck with for over a year, and it paid off.

## Be grateful

I had to make some hard decisions and turn down some great opportunities to wind up here.  I'm really lucky to have had those options.

I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm excited to learn and see where this takes me.

Good luck!
